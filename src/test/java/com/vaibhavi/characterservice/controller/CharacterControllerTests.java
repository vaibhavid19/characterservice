//    Then I am returned a JSON character object using the following rules:
//
//    The values for int, wis, cha, str, des returned are generated at Random and all fall between 8 and 18.
//    If class = Warrior then the highest number should be assigned to Str and the lowest to Int,
//    if the class = Archer then the highest number goes to Dex and lowested to Cha,
//    if the class is Wizard then the highest number goes to Int and the lowest to Str,
//    if the class is Rogue then highest goes to Cha and the lowest goes to Str.
